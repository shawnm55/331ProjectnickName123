A chrome extension needs 1 thing: a manifest json file, named "manifest.json". The manifest needs 3 things:
A manifest_version (2 seems to be the standard), A version (like "1.1" or "3.0"), and a name.
{
	"manifest_version": 2,
	"version": "1.0",
	"name": "331Project",
}
will create a chrome extension.

I don't know how it works for other languages, but at least with javascript, you can add a list of 
content_scripts, background scripts, and other things to the manifest.
Content scripts will load and run for every individual web page. This is good for altering what
a website looks like or does.
Background scripts will load as soon as the chrome browser is open and run until it's closed. This
is good for listening for user actions, like probably can listen for when the user types and
record everything they type.

To test an extension, put all script files, icon, and manifest in a folder. Go to the exentions page in 
chrome and toggle developer mode on. Then click load unpacked and upload the folder.
